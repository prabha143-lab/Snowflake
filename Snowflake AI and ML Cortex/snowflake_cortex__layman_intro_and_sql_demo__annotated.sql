Snowflake Cortex — AI Inside Your Data Warehouse
Cortex is Snowflake’s built-in AI engine. It lets you run powerful language models (LLMs) directly inside Snowflake—no need to export data or set up external ML tools.

🧠 What Can Cortex Do?
Task	What It Means in Simple Terms
✅ Text summarization	Turn long feedback into short summaries
✅ Sentiment analysis	Detect if a review is positive or negative
✅ Keyword extraction	Pull out important words from messy text
✅ Translation	Convert text between languages
✅ Text generation	Write product descriptions, emails, etc.
✅ SQL generation (Cortex Analyst)	Ask questions like “What were Q3 sales?” and get SQL back
🧪 Real-Life Example
You have this feedback:

"I love the new interface! It’s clean, fast, and easy to use. However, I wish the export feature supported more formats."

You run:

sql
SELECT snowflake.cortex.complete(
  OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
    'model', 'snowflake-arctic',
    'prompt', 'Summarize this customer feedback: "I love the new interface..."'
  )
) AS summary;
And Cortex replies:

"Customer likes the interface but wants more export options."

🧰 Why It’s Powerful
No Python or ML setup needed

Works inside Snowflake with SQL or Snowpark

Perfect for dashboards, reports, and automation

Layman Analogy
Think of Cortex like a smart assistant inside Snowflake:

You give it a messy paragraph → it gives you a clean summary.

You ask it to translate → it speaks the new language.

You ask it to find emotions → it tells you if the customer is happy or frustrated.

No need to export data, use Python, or build ML models. Just ask Cortex directly in SQL or Python.
