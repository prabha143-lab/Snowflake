ETL vs ELT – What Every Data Engineer Should Know
🔹 What is ETL?
ETL = Extract → Transform → Load

Data is extracted from source systems.

It is transformed externally using tools such as Informatica, SSIS, Apache Spark, or Azure Data Factory.

The transformed data is then loaded into the target data warehouse.

✅ When to Use ETL
When transformations are heavy and must be performed before loading.

When the target system has limited compute capacity.

When working with traditional on-prem or legacy data warehouses.

🔹 What is ELT?
ELT = Extract → Load → Transform

Data is extracted from source systems.

It is loaded directly into a modern cloud data warehouse or data lake such as Snowflake, BigQuery, Azure Synapse, or Databricks.

Transformations are performed inside the target system, leveraging its scalable compute power.

✅ When to Use ELT
When working with cloud-native platforms that support large-scale transformations.

When you need fast ingestion of raw data into the warehouse or lake.

When you want to retain both raw and transformed data for flexibility (e.g., Data Lakehouse patterns).

🔹 Key Differences Between ETL and ELT
Processing Location

ETL: Transformations happen in an external engine.

ELT: Transformations occur inside the data warehouse or lake.

Transformation Timing

ETL: Data is transformed before loading.

ELT: Data is transformed after loading.

Latency

ETL: Higher latency due to pre-load transformation.

ELT: Lower latency since raw data is ingested first.

Scalability

ETL: Limited scalability, depends on external ETL tools.

ELT: Highly scalable, leverages cloud-native compute resources.

Use Case

ETL: Best suited for legacy systems, on-prem warehouses, or strict compliance environments.

ELT: Ideal for modern cloud platforms, lakehouse architectures, and flexible data modeling.

Raw Data Retention

ETL: Raw data is often discarded after transformation.

ELT: Raw data is typically retained alongside transformed data.

Tooling

ETL: Uses tools like Informatica, SSIS, Apache Spark, Azure Data Factory.

ELT: Uses platforms like Snowflake SQL, dbt, BigQuery SQL, Databricks notebooks.

🔹 Why This Matters for Data Engineers
ELT is becoming the standard in cloud-first environments due to its scalability, speed, and cost-efficiency.

ETL remains relevant for enterprises with legacy infrastructure or strict compliance requirements.

As a data engineer, you must be comfortable designing both ETL and ELT pipelines based on business needs, platform capabilities, and performance goals.

💡 Takeaway
ETL and ELT are not competitors — they are complementary approaches to data pipeline design.

The real skill lies in knowing which approach to use, when, and designing a solution that balances:

⚙️ Performance

💰 Cost

🛠️ Maintainability
