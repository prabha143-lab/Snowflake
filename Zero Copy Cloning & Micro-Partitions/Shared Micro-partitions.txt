Shared Micro-partitions: When you clone a table (emp), do the original and the cloned table share the same micro-partitions?

When you clone a table, the original and the clone both point to the same micro-partitions. 
This is Zero-Copy Cloning, which is instant and uses no extra storage initially. 
The clone is a separate logical table, but it shares the physical data with the original.



DML on Cloned Table: If you perform DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on the cloned table, will new micro-partitions be created for all three operations?

Any DML operation (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) on the cloned table triggers Snowflake's "copy-on-write" mechanism. 
Because micro-partitions are immutable, Snowflake creates new micro-partitions to store the changes. 
The cloned table's metadata then updates to point to these new partitions, while the original table's pointers remain unchanged.

DML on Original Table: If you then perform DML operations on the original table, will the changes be reflected in the cloned table?

Changes to the original table are not reflected in the cloned table. The clone is a static snapshot of the original at the moment it was created. 
It remains completely independent and isolated from any new data or modifications made to the original table.


Here is a concise, short summary of the concepts you provided.

Shared Micro-partitions
When you clone a table, the original and the clone both point to the same micro-partitions. This is Zero-Copy Cloning, which is instant and uses no extra storage initially. The clone is a separate logical table, but it shares the physical data with the original.

DML on Cloned Table
Any DML operation (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) on the cloned table triggers Snowflake's "copy-on-write" mechanism. Because micro-partitions are immutable, Snowflake creates new micro-partitions to store the changes. The cloned table's metadata then updates to point to these new partitions, while the original table's pointers remain unchanged.

DML on Original Table
Changes to the original table are not reflected in the cloned table. The clone is a static snapshot of the original at the moment it was created. It remains completely independent and isolated from any new data or modifications made to the original table.
