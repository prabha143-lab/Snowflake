Scenario 1: Table without a Cluster Key
*******************************************************

1. Create Table:

CREATE TABLE my_large_table (
    id INT,
    product_category VARCHAR,
    order_date DATE
);
•	What happens: Snowflake creates the logical structure for the my_large_table. At this point, no storage has been consumed because there is no data.

2. Insert Data:
Now, let's insert some data. For this example, imagine we are inserting data from multiple sources in a random order, not sorted by date or category.

INSERT INTO my_large_table (id, product_category, order_date) VALUES
(1, 'electronics', '2024-03-01'),
(2, 'books', '2024-01-15'),
(3, 'electronics', '2024-02-20'),
(4, 'clothing', '2024-01-05'),
(5, 'books', '2024-03-25');
•	What happens: Snowflake takes the incoming data and organizes it into micro-partitions. 
Because there is no cluster key, the data is simply added to the next available micro-partition in the order it was received. 
This is called natural clustering.
•	Result: The data for 'books' and 'electronics' gets scattered across multiple micro-partitions. 
When you run a query like SELECT * FROM my_large_table WHERE product_category = 'books', Snowflake may have to 
scan all of the micro-partitions to find all the relevant rows, which can be inefficient for a very large table.

Scenario 2: Table with a Cluster Key

*****************************************************
1. Create Table:

CREATE TABLE my_large_table (
    id INT,
    product_category VARCHAR,
    order_date DATE
)
CLUSTER BY (product_category, order_date);

•	What happens: Snowflake creates the logical table and notes the specified cluster key (product_category, order_date). 
This tells Snowflake that this table is a clustered table and that it should be actively managed.

2. Insert Data:
Now, we insert the exact same data as before.

INSERT INTO my_large_table (id, product_category, order_date) VALUES
(1, 'electronics', '2024-03-01'),
(2, 'books', '2024-01-15'),
(3, 'electronics', '2024-02-20'),
(4, 'clothing', '2024-01-05'),
(5, 'books', '2024-03-25');
•	What happens: The data is initially loaded into micro-partitions in the order it was received, just like in the first scenario. 
However, because a cluster key is defined, Snowflake's automatic clustering service starts working in the background. 
It will reorganize the micro-partitions to ensure that data with similar product_category and order_date values are physically co-located.
•	Result: Over time, the data for 'books' will be grouped together, and within that group, it will be sorted by order_date. 
The same will happen for 'electronics' and 'clothing'. This makes queries that filter on these columns much more efficient.
For example, when you run SELECT * FROM my_large_table WHERE product_category = 'books', Snowflake can use the metadata 
from its micro-partitions to quickly identify and scan only the micro-partitions that contain 'books' data, skipping all others. 
This process is called pruning and is the main benefit of using a cluster key

“For high-volume tables, I use clustering keys to optimize query performance. 
By aligning physical storage with common filter patterns, I reduce scan time and improve cost efficiency—especially in analytics-heavy environments.”
