-- Table A: List of countries (Team A)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE TableA (
    country STRING
);

-- Table B: List of countries (Team B)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE TableB (
    country STRING

-- Insert countries into TableA
INSERT INTO TableA (country) VALUES

-- Insert countries into TableB
INSERT INTO TableB (country) VALUES

TableA contains: India, Australia, England, South Africa

TableB contains: Pakistan, West Indies, New Zealand, Sri Lanka

There is no overlapâ€”no country appears in both tables. So when you run:

SELECT
    A.country AS team_1,
    B.country AS team_2
FROM
    TableA A
CROSS JOIN
    TableB B;

You want to generate unique country matchups where each pair appears only once, and India vs Australia is included but Australia vs India is excluded. This means you are looking for non-repeating, non-reversed combinations across both tables.

SELECT
    A.country AS team_1,
    B.country AS team_2
FROM
    (
        SELECT country FROM TableA
        UNION
        SELECT country FROM TableB
    ) A
JOIN
    (
        SELECT country FROM TableA
        UNION
        SELECT country FROM TableB
    ) B
ON
    A.country < B.country;
